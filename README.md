# spacetime-metadata
This repo contains the metadata for space time metaverse. This will be replaced by a dencetralized system build on Cardano where all the metadata is stored in transactions. The team is still working on a fair way to distribute the space chunks, until then, you can simply claim one by going to our Discord Community.

Once you have claimed  chunk on the Discord, you can come edit the metadata to add your creation. All you have to do is:
1. open the file in edit mode
2. Copy the example and paste it at the end of the json
4. Change the corresponding feilds.
5. Commit the file
